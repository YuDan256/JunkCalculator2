## Technical Overview

### Architecture
- **Lexer**: Tokenizer supporting over 55 token types, including string interpolation (`f""`), raw strings with custom delimiters (`r"TAG()TAG"`), alternating single/double quotes, imaginary suffixes (`3i`), and variadic ellipsis (`...`).
- **Parser**: Recursive descent parser producing an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) with over 30 node types. Supports operator precedence, block statements, comma sequence evaluation, and destructuring.
- **Compiler**: Features a Sea of Nodes Intermediate Representation (IR) and Static Single Assignment (SSA) form. Includes a multi-pass optimization pipeline (CSE, DCE, Constant Folding) and utilizes Graph Coloring for register allocation.
- **Virtual Machine**: Register-based bytecode interpreter. Implements inline caching, low-level fast paths, tail call optimization (TCO), exception handling with line-number unwinding, an interactive step-debugger, execution profiling, and dynamic operator dispatching.

### Language Semantics
- **Type System & Memory Management**: NaN-boxing backed dynamic typing supporting 20+ internal types (including hidden types). 
  - *Value Types*: Scalars (double, BigInt, Complex) and Matrices (Real, Complex, String) use contiguous memory and pass-by-value semantics.
  - *Reference Types*: Containers (`List`, `Dict`, `Set`) and OOP `Instance`s use pass-by-reference semantics (backed by PIMPL architecture and `std::shared_ptr`).
- **Gradual Typing**: Optional runtime type contracts for function parameters and return values (e.g., `func(a: double, b: matrix) -> bool = ...`). Supports base types, containers, and class inheritance definitions.
- **Garbage Collection (GC)**: Mark-and-Sweep Garbage Collector (`GcHeap`) executing on top of the VM stack. Traces GC roots (Globals, Stack, Upvalues, and Contexts) to resolve cyclic references.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Single inheritance (`extends`), `super` dispatching, and operator overloading via dunder methods (e.g., `__add__`). Instances support destructuring assignment.
- **Control Flow & Pattern Matching**: `if/else`, `while`, `for`, `for-in`, `switch/case`, `match` (with deep destructuring and dependent binding), `break/continue/return`, and `defer` for resource cleanup.
- **Error Handling**: `try/catch/throw` constructs, structured `Exception` objects, and functional `pcall` with stack tracebacks.
- **Metaprogramming**: AST-based compile-time macro system (`macro`) with code quoting (`quote`), unquoting (`$`), and hygienic macros (`gensym`) for code generation.
- **Execution Control**: Robust `Ctrl+C` interrupt mechanism to safely halt infinite loops or heavy CAS computations without crashing the VM. Pressing `Ctrl+C` three times consecutively triggers an immediate hard exit.
- **Functions**: Closures, lambdas `(x) => expr`, default parameters, variadic arguments (`...args`), and `ref` parameter binding.
- **Generic Container API**: Array manipulation functions (`push`, `slice`, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `sort`, `join`, `zip`, etc.) operate across four container types: `RealMatrix`, `ComplexMatrix`, `StringMatrix`, and `List` (with `@[...]` forced literal syntax).
- **Set Algebra**: `Set` type (with `@{...}` literal syntax) providing O(1) membership testing (`in`). Supports operators for union (`|`), intersection (`&`), difference (`-`), and Cartesian product (`*`). Includes powerset generation (`setPow`) and relation predicates.

### Mathematics & CAS Engine
- **Computer Algebra System (CAS)**: A symbolic mathematics engine operating on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG). Features simplification (`simplify`, `expand`, `contract`, `factor`, `trigsimp`), symbolic calculus (`diff`, `integ`, `limit`, `taylor`), and exact analytic root finding (`solveEq`).
- **Polynomial Algebra**: Uses Subresultant Pseudo-Remainder Sequences for polynomial GCD, and Finite Field $\mathbb{Z}_p$ mapping (Cantor-Zassenhaus algorithm) for multivariate factorization. 
- **Integration Engine**: Implements subsets of the Risch algorithm, including Hermite reduction, the Rothstein-Trager algorithm, and Liouvillian differential field extensions.
- **Arbitrary-Precision**: Base-10^9 compressed `BigInt` layout. Implements high-base division, GCD/LCM, and modular exponentiation.
- **Exact Rationals & Promotion**: `Fraction` types recursively cross-reduce. Exact rational powers (e.g., `(1/2)^(1/2)`) that cannot be resolved numerically auto-promote into `SymExpr` CAS trees to prevent floating-point precision loss.
- **Linear Algebra**: `Matrix<T>` template supporting Gaussian-Jordan elimination, QR decomposition (Modified Gram-Schmidt), LU decomposition (Doolittle partial pivoting), and Eigenvalues (Hessenberg + Givens QR iteration).

### Native Modules & Standard Library
Native C++ extensions exposed to the execution context:
- `image`: OOP-based BMP generation, drawing primitives with SDF (Signed Distance Field) sub-pixel anti-aliasing, and ASCII font rendering.
- `prob`: OOP-based statistical distributions (PDF, CDF, Quantile via Newton iteration) and hypothesis tests.
- `json`: JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `socket`: Low-level TCP/IP networking stack (WinSock2/POSIX bindings).
- `bytes`: Memory buffering and low-level binary I/O operations.
- `window`: Native GUI window rendering engine. Supports Mouse-Look pointer capturing and independent IME toggling (Win32).
- `latex`: Bi-directional LaTeX engine. Serializes JC2 objects to LaTeX, and parses raw LaTeX formulas into executable closures.
- `ffi` (experimental): Zero-dependency Foreign Function Interface. Supports dynamic loading of shared libraries (DLL/SO), direct C ABI function invocation, and raw memory/pointer manipulation.

JC2 standard libraries loaded via `import`:
- `collections`: Data structures including `Stack`, `Queue`, `Deque`, `PriorityQueue` (Heap), and Search Trees.
- `regex`: Object-Oriented NFA regex engine with capture groups, alternation, and quantifiers.
- `discrete`: Discrete mathematics toolkit covering combinatorics, binary relations, and graph traversal.
- `engine`: Game framework abstraction over the `window` module for render loops and event state management.
- `net`: OOP wrapper for TCP streams (`TcpSocket` and `TcpServer`).
- `http`: HTTP/1.1 client supporting URL parsing and GET/POST requests.
- `buffer`: Binary manipulation API with cursor support.

## What's New in v2.5.1.0

### Compile-Time Metaprogramming & Macros
- **AST Macro Engine**: Introduced `macro`, `quote`, and `$` syntax for AST-level code generation and replacement at compile time.
- **Compile-Time Imports**: Added `import @` syntax to load macros and helpers during the parsing phase, automatically unloading them afterward to ensure zero runtime scope pollution.
- **Hygienic Macros**: Introduced the `gensym` mechanism to generate non-denotable internal identifiers, preventing variable name collisions during macro expansion.

### Structured Exceptions & Resource Management
- **Structured Exception Objects**: Introduced a standard `Exception` class. User-thrown exceptions are now automatically boxed and populated with a complete `traceback`.
- **Deferred Execution**: Added the `defer` keyword to automatically execute resource cleanup code when exiting the current scope (whether returning normally or throwing an exception).
- **Precise Line Tracking**: Optimized source line mapping for control flow statements (`throw`, `return`, `break`, `continue`) during AST conversion, making error localization much more accurate.

### VM & Frontend Optimizations
- **Output Semantics Separation**: Clearly distinguished between `toString` (human-readable) and `toRepr` (debug output), significantly improving REPL and error log formatting.
- **OOP Enhancements**: Indexing access (`obj[key]`) now automatically falls back to standard field access (`obj.key`) if the instance lacks `__getitem__` or `__setitem__` dunder methods.
- **Module System Standardization**: Unified terminology (C-API extensions as `library`, JC2 scripts as `module`) and enhanced path resolution logic.

## Building

Requires a C++20 compliant compiler and CMake 3.15+.

    cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    cmake --build build --config Release

*Note: On MSVC, the CMake script uses `/MT` static linkage and Link Time Code Generation (`/GL`, `/LTCG`).*

---

## Command-Line Interface

    JunkCalculator2                    # Interactive REPL session
    JunkCalculator2 script.jc2         # Execute a script
    JunkCalculator2 --run script.jc2   # Execute a script (explicit flag)
    JunkCalculator2 script.jc2 -d      # Execute and print bytecode disassembly
    JunkCalculator2 script.jc2 --debug # Execute with interactive step-debugger
    JunkCalculator2 script.jc2 --profile # Execute and print performance report

*Script Path Context: The `run` and `import` instructions push the executing script's directory onto a paths stack, resolving relative I/O based on the current file's location rather than the terminal's working directory.*
