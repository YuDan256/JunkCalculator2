A scripting language and computer algebra system (CAS) implemented in C++20. It relies on a custom bytecode compiler and a stack-based virtual machine, requiring no third-party dependencies.

Developed by Yu Liangyang, Tsinghua University.

## Technical Overview

### Architecture
- **Lexer**: Tokenizer supporting over 55 token types, including string interpolation (`f""`), raw strings with custom delimiters (`r"TAG()TAG"`), alternating single/double quotes, imaginary suffixes (`3i`), and variadic ellipsis (`...`).
- **Parser**: Recursive descent parser producing an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) with over 30 node types. Supports operator precedence, block statements, comma sequence evaluation, and destructuring.
- **Compiler**: AST-to-bytecode compiler utilizing the Visitor pattern. Handles lexical scoping, auto-local variable declaration, loop patching, and closure capture.
- **Virtual Machine**: Stack-based bytecode interpreter. Implements inline caching, tail call optimization (TCO), late-binding for function calls, exception handling with line-number unwinding, an interactive step-debugger, execution profiling, and dynamic operator dispatching.

### Language Semantics
- **Type System & Memory Management**: NaN-boxing backed dynamic typing supporting 20+ internal types (including hidden types). 
  - *Value Types*: Scalars (double, BigInt, Complex) and Matrices (Real, Complex, String) use contiguous memory and pass-by-value semantics.
  - *Reference Types*: Containers (`List`, `Dict`, `Set`) and OOP `Instance`s use pass-by-reference semantics (backed by PIMPL architecture and `std::shared_ptr`).
- **Gradual Typing**: Optional runtime type contracts for function parameters and return values (e.g., `func(a: double, b: matrix) -> bool = ...`). Supports base types, containers, and class inheritance definitions.
- **Garbage Collection (GC)**: Mark-and-Sweep Garbage Collector (`GcHeap`) executing on top of the VM stack. Traces GC roots (Globals, Stack, Upvalues, and Contexts) to resolve cyclic references.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Single inheritance (`extends`), `super` dispatching, and operator overloading via dunder methods (e.g., `__add__`). Instances support destructuring assignment.
- **Control Flow & Pattern Matching**: `if/else`, `while`, `for`, `for-in`, `switch/case`, `match` (with deep destructuring and dependent binding), `break/continue/return`.
- **Error Handling**: `try/catch/throw` constructs and functional `pcall` with stack tracebacks.
- **Execution Control**: Robust `Ctrl+C` interrupt mechanism to safely halt infinite loops or heavy CAS computations without crashing the VM. Pressing `Ctrl+C` three times consecutively triggers an immediate hard exit.
- **Functions**: Closures, lambdas `(x) => expr`, default parameters, variadic arguments (`...args`), and `ref` parameter binding.
- **Generic Container API**: Array manipulation functions (`push`, `slice`, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `sort`, `join`, `zip`, etc.) operate across four container types: `RealMatrix`, `ComplexMatrix`, `StringMatrix`, and `List` (with `@[...]` forced literal syntax).
- **Set Algebra**: `Set` type (with `@{...}` literal syntax) providing O(1) membership testing (`in`). Supports operators for union (`|`), intersection (`&`), difference (`-`), and Cartesian product (`*`). Includes powerset generation (`setPow`) and relation predicates.

### Mathematics & CAS Engine
- **Computer Algebra System (CAS)**: A symbolic mathematics engine operating on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG). Features simplification (`simplify`, `expand`, `contract`, `factor`, `trigsimp`), symbolic calculus (`diff`, `integ`, `limit`, `taylor`), and exact analytic root finding (`solveEq`).
- **Polynomial Algebra**: Uses Subresultant Pseudo-Remainder Sequences for polynomial GCD, and Finite Field $\mathbb{Z}_p$ mapping (Cantor-Zassenhaus algorithm) for multivariate factorization. 
- **Integration Engine**: Implements subsets of the Risch algorithm, including Hermite reduction, the Rothstein-Trager algorithm, and Liouvillian differential field extensions.
- **Arbitrary-Precision**: Base-10^9 compressed `BigInt` layout. Implements high-base division, GCD/LCM, and modular exponentiation.
- **Exact Rationals & Promotion**: `Fraction` types recursively cross-reduce. Exact rational powers (e.g., `(1/2)^(1/2)`) that cannot be resolved numerically auto-promote into `SymExpr` CAS trees to prevent floating-point precision loss.
- **Linear Algebra**: `Matrix<T>` template supporting Gaussian-Jordan elimination, QR decomposition (Modified Gram-Schmidt), LU decomposition (Doolittle partial pivoting), and Eigenvalues (Hessenberg + Givens QR iteration).

### Native Modules & Standard Library
Native C++ extensions exposed to the execution context:
- `image`: OOP-based BMP generation, drawing primitives with SDF (Signed Distance Field) sub-pixel anti-aliasing, and ASCII font rendering.
- `prob`: OOP-based statistical distributions (PDF, CDF, Quantile via Newton iteration) and hypothesis tests.
- `json`: JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `socket`: Low-level TCP/IP networking stack (WinSock2/POSIX bindings).
- `bytes`: Memory buffering and low-level binary I/O operations.
- `window`: Native GUI window rendering engine. Supports Mouse-Look pointer capturing and independent IME toggling (Win32).
- `latex`: Bi-directional LaTeX engine. Serializes JC2 objects to LaTeX, and parses raw LaTeX formulas into executable closures.
- `ffi` (experimental): Zero-dependency Foreign Function Interface. Supports dynamic loading of shared libraries (DLL/SO), direct C ABI function invocation, and raw memory/pointer manipulation.

JC2 standard libraries loaded via `import`:
- `collections`: Data structures including `Stack`, `Queue`, `Deque`, `PriorityQueue` (Heap), and Search Trees.
- `regex`: Object-Oriented NFA regex engine with capture groups, alternation, and quantifiers.
- `discrete`: Discrete mathematics toolkit covering combinatorics, binary relations, and graph traversal.
- `engine`: Game framework abstraction over the `window` module for render loops and event state management.
- `net`: OOP wrapper for TCP streams (`TcpSocket` and `TcpServer`).
- `http`: HTTP/1.1 client supporting URL parsing and GET/POST requests.
- `buffer`: Binary manipulation API with cursor support.

## What's New in v2.4.4.2

### Compiler & Pattern Matching Fixes
- **Explicit State Initialization Flag**: Fixed an issue where the `state` keyword flag in destructuring assignments could pollute subsequent normal destructuring assignments. By explicitly passing the `isStateInit` parameter to `compilePatternMatch`, normal destructuring assignments (e.g., `[a, b] = [b, a + b]`) are no longer mistakenly treated as state initialization statements, preventing the erroneous emission of `OP_IS_UNINIT` instructions.
- **Top-Level State Declaration**: Disallowed `state` declarations at the top level (global scope) since they are meant for closure-private persistent state.
- **Local Variable Capture**: Independent `local a` declarations (without explicit initialization) now correctly capture outer variables by value or throw an `Undefined variable` exception if not found.

### Frontend & Parsing
- **Dictionary vs. Block Resolution**: Improved the lookahead scanner to accurately distinguish between shorthand dictionary literals and code blocks. Shorthand dictionaries now strictly require commas between elements and only allow identifiers, rest operators, and scope modifiers. This prevents comma expressions like `{1, 2}` or multi-line blocks from being misparsed as dictionaries.

### Virtual Machine & Tail Call Optimization (TCO)
- **Full Tail Call Optimization Enabled**: Removed the conservative restriction in the compiler that disabled TCO when cross-function calls might involve reference passing. Since the VM safely closes over local variables (`closeUpvalues`) before executing a tail call (`OP_TAIL_CALL`), passing references during tail calls is perfectly safe. This update restores full tail recursion optimization, completely resolving stack overflow issues in mutually tail-recursive scenarios.
- **Infinite Pattern Matching**: Upgraded `OP_MATCH_SHAPE` operands to 32-bit, extending the maximum pattern matching limit to infinity (4,294,967,295) for rest patterns (`...rest`).

## Building

Requires a C++20 compliant compiler and CMake 3.15+.

    cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    cmake --build build --config Release

*Note: On MSVC, the CMake script uses `/MT` static linkage and Link Time Code Generation (`/GL`, `/LTCG`).*

---

## Command-Line Interface

    JunkCalculator2                    # Interactive REPL session
    JunkCalculator2 script.jc2         # Execute a script
    JunkCalculator2 --run script.jc2   # Execute a script (explicit flag)
    JunkCalculator2 script.jc2 -d      # Execute and print bytecode disassembly
    JunkCalculator2 script.jc2 --debug # Execute with interactive step-debugger
    JunkCalculator2 script.jc2 --profile # Execute and print performance report

*Script Path Context: The `run` and `import` instructions push the executing script's directory onto a paths stack, resolving relative I/O based on the current file's location rather than the terminal's working directory.*
